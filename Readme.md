# SalatBar

## what is the idea behind the project.

I'd like to be able to get the builds from my repository and ship em into Docker.

- the app should be able to connect with a repository
- see if it has a build that can be deployed
- generate a configuration for the deployment (lane)s and stuff like that

to be continued... 

## Run using Docker 

In Linux use following command ```docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.development.yml up```
